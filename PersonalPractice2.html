        <li>Donkey Kong Country</li>
        <p>
          is a 1994 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo
          for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It is a reboot of
          Nintendo's Donkey Kong franchise and follows the gorilla Donkey Kong
          and his nephew Diddy Kong as they set out to recover their stolen
          banana hoard from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. In 40 side-scrolling
          levels, the player collects items, defeats enemies and bosses, and
          finds secrets on their journey to defeat K. Rool. In the multiplayer
          modes, two players can work together cooperatively or race each other.

        <li>Contra</li>
        <p>
          is a video game series produced by Konami composed primarily of run
          and gun-style shooting games. The series debuted in 1987 as a
          coin-operated arcade game titled Contra, which was followed by the
          release of Super Contra in 1988 and several sequels produced for
          various home platforms

        <li>The Legend of Zelda A Link to The Past</li>
        <p>
          is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for
          the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game in The
          Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in
          North America and Europe. The story is officially set many years
          before the events of the first two Zelda games. The player assumes the
          role of Link as he journeys to save Hyrule, defeat the demon king
          Ganon, and rescue the descendants of the Seven Sages. It returns to a
          top-down perspective similar to the original The Legend of Zelda,
          dropping the side-scrolling gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of
          Link. It introduced series staples such as parallel worlds and items
          including the Master Sword.

        <li>Super Mario World</li>
        <p>
          is a 1990 platform game developed by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo
          Entertainment System (SNES). The story follows Mario's quest to save
          Princess Toadstool and Dinosaur Land from the series' antagonist
          Bowser and his minions, the Koopalings. The gameplay is similar to
          that of earlier Super Mario games: players control Mario or his
          brother Luigi through a series of levels in which the goal is to reach
          the goalpost at the end. Super Mario World introduced Yoshi, a
          dinosaur who can eat enemies, as well as gain abilities by eating the
          shells of Koopa Troopas.
